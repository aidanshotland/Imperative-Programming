Developed a C program capable of reading grayscale images in pgm format, where pixel values range from 0 to 255, treated as unsigned characters.
Implement functionality to load the image data into a 2D matrix.
Modify the 2D matrix to perform image thresholding, converting it into a binary image.
Implement rotation functionality to rotate the image left within the 2D matrix.
Revert the manipulated 2D matrices back to grayscale images for visualization purposes.
